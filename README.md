## Custom dashboard application for Next.js App Router Course.

This was created as part of the Next.js App Router course on the Next.js website. It is a dashboard application that uses the Next.js App Router to navigate between pages and optimizations for images, fonts, and rendering strategies with server components and client components. it was fun and educational to build.

Thanks to the Next.js team for the great course for a quick and easy way to update my skills, so now we are ready to upgrate our applications to the latest version of Next.js.
